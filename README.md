### Key Classes and Systems

#### PhysicsState (utils.py:15-124)
Thread-safe state management for physics objects:
- `physics_dropper`: Main simulation state (active/passive objects, dropped status)
- `rigidbody`: Rigid body specific state (world settings, high/low poly objects)
- `cloth`: Cloth simulation state
- `earthquake`: F-curve modifier tracking for earthquake effects

#### SafeOperation (logger.py)
Context manager for safe Blender operations with error handling and performance tracking.

#### Baking System (bake_utils.py)
- `rb_bake_from_current_cache()`: Cache preparation for keyframe baking
- `clear_rigidbody_bake()`: Cache clearing functionality
- `delete_collider()`: Cleanup collider objects after baking

## Recent Changes & Development Notes

### Latest Updates (2024)

#### Baking System Improvements
- **Removed Cache Baking**: Eliminated the problematic "Bake to Cache" functionality that was causing object positioning and cache corruption issues
- **Enhanced Keyframe Baking**: Improved the "Bake to Keyframes" feature to only bake up to the current timeline position
  - Now intelligently stops at the current frame instead of processing the entire timeline
  - More efficient workflow: pause simulation at desired frame, then bake
  - Preserves earthquake effects and external forces in baked keyframes

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Better Button Sizing**: Improved visual hierarchy of simulation control buttons
  - Apply and Bake to Keyframes buttons are now prominently sized
  - Secondary controls (Pause/Play) are appropriately smaller
  - Force properties and earthquake controls are properly sized for readability

#### Code Quality
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Removed unused and problematic code paths
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced validation for frame ranges and simulation states
- **Improved Logging**: More descriptive messages for baking operations

## Version History

- **v1.3.0**: Current version with streamlined baking system and improved UI
- **v1.2.0**: Previous version with enhanced cloth simulation
- Compatible with Blender 2.93.5+ and fully tested with Blender 4.5+
